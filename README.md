# Functionality Preserving Shape Style Transfer

[Project Page](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/papers/StyleTransfer)

## Introduction

This archive contains C++ code for the Style Transfer project. **Visual Studio 2013** or above is required to compile the code. Our code is released under **GPL v3** license. 

## How to Compile ##

1. Open Visual Studio solution `build/Style.sln`
2. Select targeting configurations (`Release | x64` is recommended)
3. Build the solution by pressing `F7`
4. Occasionally Visual Studio will complain about the error below. The reason for this error may be the heavy dependencies of other third party libraries in this project. If this happens, just build the solution one more time.
> error C1002: compiler is out of heap space in pass 2


## How to Run ##

1. After compiling the project, the binary executables are inside folder `output`
2. Download the demo data set from the [project page](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/papers/StyleTransfer). Unzip the file to anywhere you want. You should now have a folder named `data`.
3. In Visual Studio, right click project `StyleSynthesis` > `Properties`. From the left-side panel, select `Configuration Properties` > `Debugging`. On the right-side window, make sure the `Command Arguments` and `Working Directory` are correct.
4. The `Working Directory` should be the path to the folder `data`. The `Command Arguments` should be the path to the `*.cfg` configuration file within any demo case folder (path should be relative to the `data` folder)
5. Run the program by pressing `Ctrl+F5`. Take a cup of coffee. 
6. After the program finishes running, the synthesized shapes should be in the `output` folder within each case folder. 

## Code Structure

The main entry point of the program is in file `src/StyleSynthesis/main.cpp`. The entire pipeline contains several steps handled by different classes. The class definitions of all those pipeline classes are inside folder `src/StyleSynthesis/IO/Pipeline`. Below is a brief explanation of the purpose of each class:

- Pre-Processing
	- `PipelineMeshIO`: pre-process input meshes
	- `PipelineCurveIO`: extract feature curves from meshes
	- `PipelineSegmentIO`: hierarchically segment input meshes
	- `PipelineGraphIO`: build context graph for compatibility measure
	- `PipelineFeatureIO`: compute shape features
	- `PipelineSimilarityIO`: compute stuffs related to style similarity
- Learning
	- `PipelineTrainPartIO`: organize data for learning part compatibility
	- `PipelineTrainLearningIO`: learn weights for part compatibility
	- `PipelineTrainCurveIO`: learn weights for curve compatibility
	- `PipelineTrainValidationIO`: learn stuffs for validation
- Style Transfer   
	- `PipelineMatchPartIO`: transfer style by element substitution/addition/removal
	- `PipelineMatchCurveIO`: transfer style by curve-based deformation

## Third-party Libraries ##

1. All third-party library header files and pre-built binary files are included in folder `3rdparty`
2. This project requires OpenGL. You will need an OpenGL capable graphics card and development environment
3. All third-party libraries used in this project are listed below:
	- [CML 1.0.3](http://cmldev.net): simple vector, matrix and quaternion operations
	- [cppoptlib](https://github.com/PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers): L-BFGS solver
	- [Eigen 3.2.7](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org): advanced matrix operations
	- [FFTW 3.3.4](http://fftw.org): discrete Fourier transform
	- [GLEW 1.11.0](http://glew.sourceforge.net): OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
	- [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/): tetrahedral mesh manipulation
	- [Thea](https://github.com/sidch/Thea): Kd tree implementation (modified)
